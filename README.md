## Features

- Generate talking avatar videos using Hedra's advanced Character-3 technology
- **Intelligent background animation** - background objects move in coordination with the main character
- Support for multiple aspect ratios (16:9, 9:16, 1:1)
- Multiple resolution options (540p, 720p)
- Auto duration or custom duration settings
- Custom emotion and gesture prompts
- Video frame extraction for ComfyUI pipeline integration
- Debug mode for troubleshooting
- API connection testing utilities

## Pricing

**Hedra Character-3 API Pricing:**
- **~3.5 to ~7 credits per second of video**
- Actual credit usage depends on video complexity and resolution
- Example: A 30-second video costs approximately 105-210 credits

## What's New in Character-3

Character-3 introduces several advanced features:
- **An othntic image to video character Animation driven by audio and music**
- **Coordinated Background Animation**: Background elements and objects move naturally in sync with the character's movements
- **Enhanced Spatial Awareness**: The AI understands the 3D space and creates more realistic depth and movement
- **Improved Gesture Recognition**: Better interpretation of prompts for natural hand movements and body language
- **Advanced Emotion Mapping**: More nuanced facial expressions that match the audio's emotional content
- **Scene Coherence**: Maintains consistency between character movements and environmental elements

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your ComfyUI custom nodes folder:
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/ShmuelRonen/ComfyUI_Hedra.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd ComfyUI_Hedra
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Restart ComfyUI

## Getting Started

### 1. Obtain API Key

1. Visit [Hedra API Profile](https://www.hedra.com/api-profile)
2. Sign up or log in to your Hedra account
3. Subscribe to a paid plan (Creator tier or higher required for API access)
4. Navigate to your API profile page
5. Copy your API key (it should start with `sk_h`)

### 2. Configure the Node

1. After installation, a `config.json` file will be created in the node folder
2. Open `config.json` and replace `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual API key:

```json
{
    "api_key": "your_api_key_here"
}
```

## Usage

### Available Nodes

#### 1. Hedra Image to Video
The main node for generating talking avatar videos using Character-3.

**Inputs:**
- `image`: Input portrait image (Start frame) - can include background elements
- `audio`: Audio file for lip-sync (Audio script)
- `prompt` (optional): Text description for emotions, gestures, and scene dynamics
- `aspect_ratio`: Choose from 16:9, 9:16, or 1:1
- `resolution`: 540p or 720p
- `use_test_mode`: Set to true for testing without API calls
- `debug_mode`: Enable detailed logging

**Outputs:**
- `images`: Video frames as a batch
- `audio`: Original audio (pass-through)
- `frame_count`: Number of frames extracted
- `video_url`: URL of the generated video
- `fps`: Frames per second (typically 24)

### Prompt Examples for Better Results

To take advantage of Character-3's advanced capabilities, try these prompt patterns:

**Basic Emotion & Gesture:**
```
"smiling warmly, gesturing with hands while speaking"
```

**With Background Interaction:**
```
"speaking enthusiastically with hands, background gently swaying with movement"
```

**Complex Scene Dynamics:**
```
"passionate speech with emphatic gestures, environment responds to emotional intensity"
```

**Specific Background Elements:**
```
"confident presentation, curtains flutter as character moves, plants sway subtly"
```

## Cost Examples

| Audio Duration | Approximate Credits | Estimated Cost Range |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 10 seconds     | 35-70 credits     | ~3.5-7 credits/sec |
| 30 seconds     | 105-210 credits   | ~3.5-7 credits/sec |
| 60 seconds     | 210-420 credits   | ~3.5-7 credits/sec |

*Note: Actual costs may vary based on video complexity and additional features used.*

## Workflow Example

1. Load an image using `Load Image` node (include background elements for best effect)
2. Load audio using an audio loader node
3. Connect both to the `Hedra Image to Video` node
4. Set your desired aspect ratio and resolution
5. Add a detailed prompt describing both character and scene dynamics
6. Connect the output frames to a `Video Combine` node or save them

## Character-3 Advanced Features

The Character-3 model from Hedra offers:
- **Scene Understanding**: AI comprehends the relationship between character and environment
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Background elements move naturally with character actions
- **Depth Perception**: Creates realistic 3D movement within 2D images
- **Motion Coherence**: Ensures all elements move in physically plausible ways
- **Adaptive Animation**: Adjusts movement intensity based on audio energy and emotion

## Best Practices for Background Animation

1. **Image Selection**: Choose images with distinct background elements (curtains, plants, furniture)
2. **Prompt Clarity**: Describe how you want the background to react to the character
3. **Audio Matching**: Background movement intensity matches audio energy levels
4. **Scene Composition**: Leave space around the character for natural movement

## Important Notes

- **API Credits**: Each video generation consumes credits from your Hedra account
- **Processing Time**: Video generation typically takes 2-5 minutes
- **Audio Length**: Longer audio files will consume more credits (3.5-7 credits per second)
- **Image Requirements**: Best results with clear face portraits and visible background elements
- **Output Format**: Videos are generated at 24 FPS

## Troubleshooting

1. **Background Not Animating**:
   - Ensure your prompt mentions background movement
   - Use images with distinct background elements
   - Try more specific scene descriptions

2. **API Key Issues**:
   - Ensure your API key is correctly set in `config.json`
   - Verify you have an active paid subscription
   - Check that your API key starts with `sk_h`

3. **Generation Failures**:
   - Enable `debug_mode` for detailed error messages
   - Verify your audio format is supported (WAV recommended)
   - Ensure your image contains a clear face
